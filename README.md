This is a program for simulating emergence of tissue flow and deformation using 2D-vertex model, where experimentally aquired cell shape from the sagittal section of an animal is approximated by polygons. 

Application: in progress

## Note

Testing and contributing is very welcome, especially if you can contribute with new algorithms and features.
